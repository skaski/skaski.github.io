**Abstract:** Research is our most promising tool for solving the
 multitude of important real problems we are facing. By improving the
 very engine of R&D (research and development) with machine learning,
 we can contribute to solving a large number of problems with domain
 experts of the respective fields. This requires contributions from a
 strong international network of collaborators in academia and
 industry, and solutions to fundamental machine learning problems that
 I call the Fundamentals of Applied AI. By these fundamentals I mean
 solutions that make AI more widely and reliably applicable for
 decision making in R&D, sometimes called AI4Science but could also be
 called AI4Research or AI4RDI. I will discuss in particular
 collaborative AI for human-AI teamwork and out-of-distribution
 transfer, and how this work is being carried out as collaboration of
 FCAI, ELLIS Institute Finland, Manchester Centre of AI Fundamentals,
 and their international partner network.
