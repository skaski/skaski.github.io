**Abstract:** I will discuss our recent machine learning contributions
  to the core engine of science, and research and development work in
  general, the design-build-test-learn loop. (Bayesian) automatic
  experimental design has been proposed for choosing the next
  measurement actions, but widespread use has been hampered by the
  required amount of computation. Expertise of domain experts is
  necessary, especially when data has high cost, and can be included
  as prior knowledge or as actively elicited preferences on the goals
  and what is important. As any data, data from experts is noisy but
  the "noise" is typically very different from other domains of
  multi-domain data, requiring user modelling. Amortization with
  neural approximations makes these computationally costly operations
  feasible.
