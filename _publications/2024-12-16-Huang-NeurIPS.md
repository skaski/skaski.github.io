Abstract: Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical
diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from
designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This
highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond
merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional
Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in
facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use
an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However,
the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for
down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently
designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present
an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing
downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the
Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly
proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the
downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a
unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across
several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and
facilitate accurate decision-making.
