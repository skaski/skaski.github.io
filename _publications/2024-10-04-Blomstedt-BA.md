Abstract: Meta-analysis aims to generalize results from multiple
related statistical analyses through a combined analysis. While the
natural outcome of a Bayesian study is a posterior distribution,
traditional Bayesian meta-analyses proceed by combining summary
statistics (i.e., point-valued estimates) computed from data. In this
paper, we develop a framework for combining posterior distributions
from multiple related Bayesian studies into a
meta-analysis. Importantly, the method is capable of reusing
pre-computed posteriors from computationally costly analyses, without
needing the implementation details from each study. Besides providing
a consensus across studies, the method enables updating the local
posteriors post-hoc and therefore refining them by sharing statistical
strength between the studies, without rerunning the original
analyses. We illustrate the wide applicability of the framework by
combining results from likelihood-free Bayesian analyses, which would
be difficult to carry out using standard methodology.
