Abstract: New scientific knowledge is needed more urgently than ever,
to address global challenges such as climate change, sustainability,
health, and societal well-being. Could artificial intelligence (AI)
accelerate science to meet these global challenges in time? AI is
already revolutionizing individual scientific disciplines, but we
argue here that it could be more holistic and encompassing. We
introduce the concept of virtual laboratories as a new perspective on
scientific knowledge generation and a means to incentivize new AI
research and development. Despite the often perceived domain-specific
research practices and inherent tacit knowledge, we argue that many
elements of the research process recur across scientific domains and
that even common software platforms for serving different domains may
be possible. We outline how virtual laboratories will make it easier
for AI researchers to contribute to a broad range of scientific
domains, and highlight the mutual benefits virtual laboratories offer
to both AI and domain scientists.
