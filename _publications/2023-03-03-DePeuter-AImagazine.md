Abstract: We need to rethink how we assist designers with artificial
intelligence (AI). AI should aim to cooperate, not automate, by
supporting and leveraging the creativity and problem-solving
capabilities of designers. The challenge for such AI is how to infer
designers' goals and then help them without being needlessly
disruptive. We introduce AI-assisted design, a new framework for
creating such AI, built around generative user models, which allow it
to infer and adapt to designers' goals, reasoning, and capabilities.
