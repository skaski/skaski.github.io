I am the founding director of [ELLIS Institute
Finland](https://ellisinstitute.fi), a Machine Learning Professor
operating 50-50 in the UK and Finland.  In Finland I also lead the
Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence [FCAI](https://fcai.fi),
and in the UK the Manchester Centre for AI Fundamentals
[AI-FUN](https://ai-fun.manchester.ac.uk). [Part of my research
group](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) is at Aalto University and
part in the University of Manchester. I will do my best to update the
rest of this page soon but my up-to-date list of papers is always in
[Google
Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uF6H9jMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

Research interests
======
 - Probabilistic modelling and Bayesian inference
 - Collaborative AI for decision making and design
 - Collaboration with many fields including health, medicine, biology, user interaction, cognitive science, neuroscience; especially when formulated as virtual simulation-based laboratories
 - Timely in ML: distribution shifts, multiple tasks and sources, generative models, experimental design, simulation-based inference, humans in the loop and theory of mind, privacy-preserving learning


Current activities

- Action editor: JMLR, IEEE TPAMI
- Regularly Area Chair (or equiv) of ML conferences including NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI
- I am very proud of the 36 PhD students and many postdocs I have mentored. Of my lab alumni, 21 have got faculty positions in Universities and the rest are entrepreneurs or in company positions (~50%) or staff members or postdocs at research institutes
